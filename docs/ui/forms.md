# Forms

Read this file for form schemas, input maps, defaults, labels, and custom
actions. Read [DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md#actions-and-forms) before selecting
the form surface or action placement.

## Form definition

Use a raw input schema with `defineForm`. Keep the selected inputs in that
form's own ordered `fields` map. The keys must belong to the schema. A display
map does not configure form inputs.

```ts
const createUserForm = defineForm({
  schema: createUserSchema,
  labels: userLabels,
  fields: {
    name: { renderer: 'text' },
    email: { renderer: 'text', props: { type: 'email' } },
    active: { renderer: 'switch', initialValue: true },
  },
  submit: usersActions.create,
})
```

Every input declares its `renderer`. Its flat `props` object follows that
component's public contract, including its supported native attributes. Use the
same prop bag when the component is standalone and when Form renders it.
Component-required props stay required. The schema supplies requiredness to the
real control; it does not select a renderer or create choices.

Use `initialData` for a fixed draft value. Use an input's `initialValue` only
when that input needs a fresh value for each form session. Do not add hidden
inputs only to satisfy a schema. The schema owns requiredness and the submitted
shape.

The draft uses each control's model value. Form does not convert that value.
For example, DateInput uses a string model. Use a string input schema and an
explicit schema transform when the operation needs another value. The schema
parses the draft before `submit` runs. Keep business validators in the form
definition when they belong to the client workflow, and enforce the same rule
on the server.

## Session values and validation

The session owns one writable draft. Form refs, slots, emitted models, and
validator or behavior contexts receive detached read-only snapshots. Arrays and
plain objects are copied and frozen at the snapshot boundary. Date values are
cloned because a frozen Date can still change through its setters. A control
update or a slot's `setValue` changes the session; direct mutation of a snapshot
does not.

Use `FormDraft<TInput>` for initial data, controlled models, loaders, and slot
values. Every input key is optional and can be `null`. An absent or `undefined`
key is unset; `null` is an explicit clear. These edit values do not change the
schema's accepted input. A non-nullable schema still rejects `null`.

An input that keeps invalid local text emits `validation:error` with a message
and emits `validation:error(undefined)` when the text becomes valid. Form
blocks submission on that event even when the input has not emitted a model
value. Each error event cancels validation that is already running. A Save
click starts submit validation against the latest settled draft, even when blur
validation is pending. Repeated clicks share one submit attempt.

A mutation belongs to the form session that started it. If the form switches
record or closes while a mutation is pending, its result, error, toast, and
pending-state cleanup do not affect the new session. The operation can finish
its own cache work; Form does not retry it or claim that the server rolled it
back.

## Resource forms

Create uses one static form bag. Update binds identity and loads its draft in the
resource form factory. Select update values explicitly in that loader:

```ts
const updateForm = defineForm({
  schema: updateUserSchema,
  labels: userLabels,
  fields: { name: { renderer: 'text' }, active: { renderer: 'switch' } },
})

export const users = defineResource({
  key: 'users',
  identity: (record: Pick<User, 'id'>) => record.id,
  create: {
    permission: 'create-users',
    form: createUserForm,
  },
  update: {
    permission: 'update-users',
    form: ({ id }) => ({
      ...updateForm,
      load: async context => {
        const record = await usersActions.detail({ ...context, id })
        return record ? { name: record.name, active: record.active } : undefined
      },
      submit: output => usersActions.update(id, output),
    }),
  },
})
```

The route passes the resulting page bag to `FormView`:

```vue
<FormView v-bind="users.update({ id: String(route.params.userId) })" />
```

The extracted update value is a page bag. Its `form` member is the complete
flat prop bag for the primitive. Use that same bag for a direct Form or a
DialogForm:

```ts
const editPage = users.update({ id: String(route.params.userId) })
```

```vue
<Form v-bind="editPage.form" />
<DialogForm v-bind="editPage.form" title="Edit user" />
<FormView v-bind="editPage" />
```

`Form` and `DialogForm` accept flat Form props. `FormView` accepts one nested
`form` bag and keeps page navigation and completion settings beside it. Do not
pass a nested `form` prop to Form or DialogForm.

Create and update declarations use the complete `FormView` props around the
nested form. Set `backTo`, `defaultTo`, `afterSubmit`, and `successMessage` on
the page declaration. The binder forwards them and keeps `form.submit` bound to
the resource access and invalidation policy. Set `defaultTo: false` or
`backTo: false` to disable the corresponding derived destination.

The update form owns its technical load and write. Do not add a page loader or
show a fake detail operation to load the draft.

## Dialog forms

Use `DialogForm` for a short contextual form. Its trigger opens the form and it
owns ordinary visibility and completion:

```vue
<DialogForm :key="record.id" v-bind="items.update({ id: record.id })" title="Edit item">
  <template #trigger>
    <Button>Edit</Button>
  </template>
</DialogForm>
```

`DialogForm` forwards the current Form props, events, input/loading/action
slots, and exposed methods. It adds only visibility and presentation members.
Supported form attributes such as `name`, `autocomplete`, ARIA, and `data-*`
reach the native form. `class` and `style` target the dialog presentation.

Use one keyed dialog for each record action. Use `v-model:open` only when
another page control must coordinate visibility. Validation and rejected writes
keep the dialog and draft available. A successful write closes the dialog
before `submitted` listeners run.

For a custom submit, keep the callback limited to the write. Start later refresh
work from `submitted`. Report a refresh failure as stale data. Do not run the
write again.

`FormView` reads `submitLabel` and `submittingLabel` from its nested `form`.
Its `actions` slot receives the Form action scope: `submit`, `reset`,
`submitting`, `submitPending`, `validating`, `dirty`, and `inputPending`. The
default actions add page navigation controls. Use the normal `actions` slot for
a replacement.

The FormView ref exposes the managed Form's read-only `draft`, `dirty`,
`submitting`, `submitPending`, `validating`, and `inputPending` state. It
forwards `validate`, `submit`, `reset`, and `refresh` to that Form.

## Select a field implementation

Use a registered input renderer, a framework composite, or `TableInput` for
editable row arrays. Build a local custom field only for a named requirement
that these controls do not support. The outer form owns the visible label,
required state, error, help text, and grid span. A custom input renders the
control only.

`TableInput` keeps its table definition and submit-free row form separate. Pass
`toDraft` to map a stored row into the row form's input shape. TableInput owns
row insert and replacement:

```vue
<TableInput
  v-model="rows"
  :table="lineItemsTable"
  :form="lineItemForm"
  :to-draft="lineItemToDraft"
/>
```

Check renderer props against the component contract. Use a `satisfies`
expression with the exported renderer prop type when a separate prop object
needs a check. A misspelled or unsupported prop must fail type checking. Keep
input and display renderer registries separate.

## Relations and dependencies

Keep the submitted relation value separate from its display label. Put a
component's loader in its field `props`. Option inputs use `load`, optional
`namespace`, and explicit `pick` and `view` props. Use `data` for static
choices. For example:

```ts
const roleInput = {
  renderer: 'select',
  props: {
    load: roles.list.table.load,
    namespace: roles.list.table.namespace,
    pick: 'id',
    view: 'name',
  },
} as const
```

A display `read` accessor or display renderer shows the returned name in table
and detail surfaces. Return the relation data needed for display from the API.
Do not fetch one label per row. The form schema accepts the control value and
does not infer choices from schema metadata.

Use pure synchronous behavior for dependencies. Keep hidden fields out of the
form schema unless the submit contract needs their values. The server remains
the authority for relation access and validation.

## Assets

Keep the stored asset object shape through read, edit, and submit. A single
asset field stores one object or `null`; a multi asset field stores an array.
Do not add client identity conversion or an input writer. Use shared upload
readiness so a form cannot submit while upload work remains pending. The
boundary example is
[`assets.form.spec.ts`](../../apps/web/src/framework/adapters/assets.form.spec.ts).

Register `adapters.assets` once through `FrameworkPlugin`. Direct and managed
FileInput/ImageInput controls and asset-mode FileComponent/ImagePreview/
ImagePreviewMulti consumers use that service. Keep URL-only preview props for
URL sources; do not combine them with the `asset` or `assets` source.

## Verification

Use `$build-resource-form` and [UI verification](../../.agents/skills/web-ui-surfaces/references/verification.md).
Choose a check that can fail on the changed behavior, such as draft loading,
dependency reset, a selected relation, or failed-save recovery. Do not add tests
that repeat input order, labels, renderer names, or standard framework behavior.

## Executable examples

Use the [Loom contract fixtures](../../packages/loom/README.md#executable-examples)
for real standalone and managed controls, date models, shared assets, and row
editing. The generated user fixture under
[`plan057_generated_users`](../../apps/web/src/framework/__type-tests__/plan057_generated_users)
is compared with fresh scaffolder output and compiles in the Web type check.
