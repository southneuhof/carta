# File-routing plans

## Resource surface architecture overhaul — 2026-09-23

Planned with `improve` at `40afee2` against
`docs/resource_system_overhaul/ARCHITECTURE.md`. This is a focused migration
audit of Loom, Carta web callers, module tooling, and active guidance. The user
selected the complete breaking change and no backwards compatibility. The
eight plans below are one delivery track. Each file is self-contained; read it
in full before execution. Intermediate plans can have documented unmigrated
caller errors. Plan 058 cannot be marked DONE until the executable old path is
gone and all required, available gates pass.

| Plan | Result | Priority | Effort | Risk | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [051](051-surface-contracts-and-schema-compiler.md) | Independent contracts, raw-schema compiler, labels, registries, inventory and cold baseline | P1 | L | HIGH | — | DONE — 24 focused and 515 Loom tests pass; web types pass; 37 Loom template-prop diagnostics and 4 baseline web test suites are recorded in the inventory |
| [052](052-form-session-and-dialog-parity.md) | One Form session and flat DialogForm parity | P1 | L | HIGH | 051 | DONE — 36 focused and 27 browser tests pass; 37 prior template errors, 9 old caller type errors, and 17 old view tests are recorded for later plans |
| [053](053-display-primitives-and-export.md) | Shared Table/TreeTable/Detail display and export reads | P1 | L | HIGH | 051 | DONE — 79 focused Loom, 11 focused browser, and 7 utility tests pass; later caller failures and 50 type diagnostics are recorded in the inventory |
| [054](054-resource-binding-and-view-bags.md) | One-object resources and complete primitive/View bags | P1 | L | HIGH | 052, 053 | DONE — 106 focused tests and ListView browser pass; full suites leave only Plan 055 TableInput/LookupInput failures; 35 later-plan/final-gate type diagnostics are recorded in the inventory |
| [055](055-composite-input-ownership.md) | Explicit filters, row forms, lookup loaders, and location editor | P1 | L | HIGH | 052, 053, 054 | DONE — reviewed after revisions; full Loom unit 502/502 and browser 34/34 pass; only two Plan 058 Drawer/Tabs type diagnostics remain |
| [056](056-migrate-web-surfaces-and-app-seams.md) | All web settings modules, routes, app seams, and presets migrated | P1 | L | HIGH | 054, 055 | DONE |
| [057](057-scaffolding-checkers-and-guidance.md) | Generator, checker, active docs, skills, and fixture output migrated | P1 | L | MED | 056 | DONE |
| [058](058-remove-legacy-paths-and-prove-completion.md) | Old code/exports removed; architecture gate and full verification | P1 | L | HIGH | 051–057 | DONE — reviewed after revisions; all required gates pass |

Execution order: **051 → 052 → 053 → 054 → 055 → 056 → 057 → 058**.
Complete and review each plan before starting the next. Do not ship a partial migration as the final architecture.
Keep framework/API and app transport contracts unchanged, as the specification
requires. The user request explicitly includes Loom framework changes.

### Vetted migration findings

| Finding | Impact | Effort | Fix risk | Confidence | Evidence | Plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Universal fields and wrapped schemas couple the three surfaces | Blocks independent type-safe authoring and raw input/output inference | L | HIGH | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/contracts/fields.ts:97-125`; `packages/loom/src/validation/zod.ts:66-90` | 051 |
| Form and DialogForm have different binding paths | Override, model-presence, and session parity cannot follow the target contract | L | HIGH | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/components/core/Form.vue:62-70`; `packages/loom/src/components/composites/DialogForm.vue:51-76` | 052 |
| Read-only surfaces and export depend on universal resolved fields | Shared accessor/format and relation captions cannot have one owner | L | HIGH | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/components/core/Detail.vue:21-45`; `packages/loom/src/services/export.ts:1-13` | 053 |
| Resources and Views still expose dual/aggregate shapes | Extracted primitive bags are not the target guarded operation contract | L | HIGH | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/resources/defineResource.ts:25-44`; `packages/loom/src/components/views/FormView.vue:41-82` | 054 |
| Composite inputs own implicit fields and cross-form writes | Nested rows/lookup cannot share the new form/display boundaries | L | HIGH | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/components/composites/form-inputs/TableInput.vue:23-35`; `LookupInput.vue:27-47` in the same directory | 055 |
| Web declarations and defaults remain on the old model | Current settings pages cannot compile after old API deletion | L | HIGH | HIGH | `apps/web/src/routes/(authenticated)/settings/users/users.resource.ts:1-19`; `apps/web/src/configs/defaults.ts:23-55` | 056 |
| Generator and active guidance recreate old code | A fresh module would regress the migration | L | MED | HIGH | `scripts/scaffold-bounded-module.mjs:610-628`; `scripts/module-ui-check.mjs:516-544` | 057 |
| Public exports and normal validation still allow old paths | A clean break cannot be proved | L | HIGH | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/index.ts:1-8`; `packages/loom/vitest.browser.config.ts:12` | 058 |

### Scope and decisions

- This audit covered `packages/loom`, the relevant `apps/web` resources and
  framework adapters, module generators/checkers, active docs/skills, and their
  verification configuration. It did not audit Sprindle, SDK, utilities, API
  implementation, dependency security, unrelated product features, or broad
  performance. Those areas are outside this migration except final workspace
  regression gates.
- The checked-out revision has no working-tree changes before these plans.
  Planning did not run type-check, unit, browser, build, or E2E commands. Plan
  051 records the cold baseline; Plan 058 records the candidate and final gates.
- Considered and rejected: compatibility overloads and aliases, because the
  requested architecture explicitly removes them; backend response changes,
  because the target preserves transport envelopes; one plan for the entire
  overhaul, because it would hide ownership, test, and dependency boundaries.

## Chokidar watcher migration — 2026-09-17

Planned with `improve` at `bf9a7ce`. The user approved the Chokidar
dependency and selected tests-then-migrate. Plan 039 locks the watcher
contract. Plan 040 was attempted twice on `advisor/040-chokidar-watcher`
and REJECTED on review: file-path watching lost add/rename/external-edit
events, dir watching flaked the external-cycle test in full-suite runs,
and installed `chokidar@5.0.0` still uses per-path `node:fs` watchers
(no `fsevents` dep), so the low-limit dev run still hit `EMFILE`.
Replan 040 from this clean slate. Plan 039 tests must pass unmodified
under any new attempt.

| Plan | Result | Priority | Effort | Risk | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [039](039-lock-watcher-contract-tests.md) | Lock route watcher add, rename, delete, and ignore rules with tests | P1 | S | LOW | None | DONE (manifest.spec 29 pass, lint 0, dev-routes pass, 354ae9d) |
| 040 | Chokidar watcher migration | P1 | S | MED | 039 | REJECTED — file watching lost events, dir watching flaked, EMFILE premise false; replan from clean slate |
| [041](041-migrate-sprindle-watcher-to-chokidar.md) | Chokidar 3.6 native watcher with atomic-input and macOS low-limit proofs | P1 | M | MED | 039 | DONE — 2026-09-18, review APPROVE; tooling 58 pass, watch 12 pass x3, lint 0, low-limit proof pass (fsevents, ulimit 128), dev-routes pass with DATABASE_URL, frozen lockfile 0, diff clean; branch `advisor/041-chokidar-3-watcher` |

Plan 041 keeps the public signature, debounce, queue, and close contract.

Plan 040 must pass plan 039 tests unmodified.
Plan 040 keeps the public signature, debounce, queue, and close contract.
Audit scope was limited to the Sprindle route watcher and its dev proof.
Product behavior, databases, broad framework quality, dependency security,
performance, and frontend behavior were not audited.

## Windows tooling portability — 2026-09-17

Planned with `improve` at `83c13b4`. The user selected all three findings as
one implementation because the cold tooling build, API filesystem paths, and
Windows regression gate must land together.

| Plan | Result | Priority | Effort | Risk | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [038](038-make-api-tooling-windows-portable.md) | Portable Sprindle tooling, API paths, subprocesses, and Windows CI | P1 | S | LOW | None | DONE — 2026-09-17, review APPROVE; cold tooling, dev startup, bundle, types, lint, and 4 focused tests pass on Windows |

Plan 038 is independent of the pending Loom plans 034, 035, and 037. It changes
only the reported Sprindle/API tooling path and its CI proof. Ad hoc
leading-slash removal, shell-launched `.cmd` files, and a two-file partial fix
were rejected because they leave encoded/UNC paths, quoting, or later API
failures unresolved.

Audit scope was limited to the reported Windows tooling and API startup/build
chain. Product behavior, databases, broad framework quality, dependency security,
performance, and frontend behavior were not audited.

## Resource and form contract enforcement — 2026-09-17

Planned with `improve` at `9d5f03e` and revised by user decision on 2026-09-18.
These plans put resource checks and component-derived form prop types in Loom
and the app schema seam. They add no agent workflow requirements. Plan 036 was
dropped because rejecting field references would remove valid custom-form and
multi-schema composition paths.

| Plan | Result | Priority | Effort | Risk | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [034](034-enforce-resource-action-declarations.md) | Exact standard actions and managed open-name custom actions | P1 | M | MED | None | DONE — reviewed 2026-09-18; Loom Types 0, 31 resource+field tests, 8 custom-action route tests, 229 web, 467 Loom (final combined tree), focused lint 0, diff --check 0; Web types fails only on the pre-existing `rpc unknown` baseline (stashed-tree identical, owners clean) |
| [035](035-enforce-resource-identity.md) | Valid identity declarations and checked runtime identities | P1 | M | MED | 034 | DONE — reviewed 2026-09-18; Loom Types 0, 38 resource+cache tests (incl. 4 identity), 1 app schema test, 467 Loom, 229 web, focused lint 0 errors (1 pre-existing TQuery warning on clean tree), diff --check 0; Web types fails only on the pre-existing baseline (owners clean) |
| [037](037-enforce-form-renderer-contracts.md) | Component-derived form prop types with open extra props | P1 | M | MED | None | DONE — reviewed 2026-09-18; Loom Types 0, 45 registry+field tests, 467 Loom, 229 web, focused app lint 0 errors, diff --check 0; Web types fails only on the pre-existing baseline (owners clean); one contract-preserving test-fixture correction recorded in the plan |

Recommended order: **034 → 035**, with **037** independent. Execute serially
when the plans touch the same framework type files. Read each plan fully before
execution. Each plan contains its own context, scope, commands, failure cases,
and stopping conditions.

### Confirmed findings

| Finding | Impact | Effort | Fix risk | Confidence | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Extra options inside standard action declarations survive generic constraints | Ignored configuration, including a misspelled client permission | M | MED | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/resources/defineResource.ts:15`; `packages/loom/src/resources/actionResource.ts:145` |
| Custom actions expose raw `run` functions and have no resource-owned permission rule | Callers must copy permission-store logic and can omit it | M | MED | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/resources/actionResource.ts:657`; the role-assignment and role-permission route components |
| Identity declaration can name an absent record property | Invalid navigation/write/cache identity | M | MED | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/contracts/schema.ts:34`; `packages/loom/src/resources/actionResource.ts:404`; `apps/web/src/framework/schema.ts:68` |
| Form renderer props are broadly typed | Values that conflict with component `defineProps` pass normal type checks | M | MED | HIGH | `packages/loom/src/contracts/fields.ts:91`; `packages/loom/src/fields/defineFields.ts:105`; `packages/loom/src/components/inputs/FileInput.vue:20` |

These are correctness/type-contract findings. The permission issue concerns
client configuration; no server authorization bypass was established.

### Baseline evidence and limits

- Loom `vue-tsc --noEmit --incremental false -p tsconfig.json`: passed.
- Five focused Loom test files: **50/50 passed** (`resources`, `defineFields`,
  `resolve`, `inputProps`, and renderer `registry`).
- Compiler probes confirmed accepted invalid standard action options, identity
  keys, file props, and renderer names.
  Positive controls confirmed standard return types, initial values, field keys,
  known option value types, and custom call arguments are checked.
- Form prop enforcement is compile-time only. Runtime prop safety is reserved
  for a later decision. Identity checking must cover the inferred app schema seam.
- Planning changed only these plans and this index. Implementation is not done.
  The full web suite, browser behavior, and new rejection checks were not run as
  completed implementation evidence.
- Field-reference inputs remain supported. Their current runtime behavior is not
  changed by these plans.

### Considered and rejected

- More skill instructions for every input: the requested invariant belongs in
  the framework.
- Accepting string `accept` values through coercion: retains an ambiguous contract.
- Treating all of `defineResource` as untyped: incorrect; several important
  existing checks work and must remain.
- Requiring all route parameters: conflicts with the established inherited
  parameter contract from Plans 031–032.
- Removing custom renderers/actions: they are supported extension points.
  Custom renderer props are inferred from the declared Vue component type.
- Keeping custom permission checks only in route components: rejected because a
  direct custom `run` call can omit them. The resource action owns `can` and the
  final `run` guard.
- Rejecting field references from core forms: rejected because real custom forms
  can combine fields from several schemas and need this escape hatch.
- Runtime form prop validation: deferred. Agents and developers use the package
  type-check commands for this contract.
- A full security or framework audit: outside the selected work. Sprindle,
  database behavior, dependency security, performance, display renderer typing,
  and product direction were not audited.

## Managed dialog forms — 2026-09-17

Planned with `improve` at `5cafda4`. The user selected this migration. Plan 033
keeps visibility inside DialogForm by default and retains controlled visibility
as the advanced option. Existing framework migration plans use this directory.

| Plan | Result | Priority | Effort | Risk | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [033](033-managed-dialog-forms.md) | Managed triggers, safe completion order, independent row dialogs and updated guidance | P1 | M | MED | None | DONE — reviewed 2026-09-17; 30 focused, 454 Loom, and 229 web tests pass |

Implementation followed the steps in 033. The completion-order regression was
red before the one-line framework fix. Loom and web type checks pass; route
generation produced no diff. Both changed skills validate. The forward test
stays stashed. No database or package publishing work is included. Reviewer
verdict: APPROVE.

Considered and rejected: public sessions; shared action-owned visibility (action
objects are cached); closing on submit start or unmount; a new controlled-dialog
alias; and treating internal visibility as missing functionality (it already exists).
The confirmed gap is completion order and the normal examples/tests favoring
external ownership. Confidence: HIGH. Whole-repo audit was not requested.

## Typed resource routes — 2026-09-16

Planned with `improve` at `c5d8f9b`. The user selected this migration, so no
general audit or additional selection step was needed. Existing plans use this
directory for framework and application migrations; numbering continues at 031.

| Plan | Result | Priority | Effort | Risk | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [031](031-check-resource-route-names.md) | Reject unknown names with fresh generated route types | P1 | M | MED | None | DONE — 2026-09-16, approved after one test revision |
| [032](032-check-resource-route-parameters.md) | Check supplied parameters and preserve inherited values | P2 | M | MED | 031 | DONE — 2026-09-16, approved after two plan reconciliations |

Execute 031 before 032. Plan 031 includes generation, the normal compiler gate,
and a stale-map regression. Plan 032 retains optional inherited parameters;
it does not claim to prove that runtime parent context exists.

Evidence: `packages/loom/src/resources/actionResource.ts:39` accepts any string
name and broad parameter records. `apps/web/package.json` type-check does not
generate route declarations. `apps/web/src/router/tabs.ts:4` already demonstrates
typed names with partial raw parameters. These findings have high confidence.

Considered and rejected: regex as the primary route contract; per-resource
opt-in helpers; mandatory parameters that break inherited parent context;
manual route maps; and runtime navigation changes in a type-only migration.

Planning inspected Loom resource types, web route generation, package commands,
the relevant CI jobs and existing route tests. No source was changed in this
planning turn. Commands are specified from source; implementation checks have
not run. API behavior, databases, security, performance, UI controls and other
Carta applications were not audited. Existing work remains unchanged.

## Current skill handoff — standard module path, 2026-09-14

Skill updates are ready; the stopped trial's database baseline is not verified.
Standard CRUD now uses one
short work record, one continuing executor and an early development preview.
Custom workflows build on that base in the same record. Full design/plan/worksheet
records apply only to a scope that needs them, not to every module with a workflow.
Relation display and edit values, requested access and usable results lead review.
Standard detail pages do not gain custom Edit/Delete controls by default.

Implementation instructions are in
[`standard-module.md`](../.agents/skills/carta-module-development/references/standard-module.md).
Forward verification of this revision is reserved for the user. Plan 024 is
already implemented (see the table below); plan 025 remains optional
follow-up work, not a prerequisite for this trial. The short
path uses existing controls, ordinary evidence and safe manual generator fallback.
No new generator, route-type command or connected-entity framework repair is
claimed as implemented. Those tool limitations remain visible if encountered.

The follow-up also reconciles the API runbook and replaces the file-upload
test's shared-table reset with existing session fixtures. No database or framework
changes were made by this follow-up.

Before the next trial, use a confirmed isolated database whose migration history
matches the selected source revision. Run the focused file-upload tests twice,
then the API suite to check cross-file effects. These runtime checks remain
unverified: the current target has unresolved drift and no local PostgreSQL or
Docker command was available. Do not reset the existing target to complete them.
Plan 024 is already implemented; keep 025 deferred. Forward
verification is reserved for the user; no speed or reliability claim is made.

## Earlier module skill follow-up — 2026-09-14

The following notes record earlier revisions. The current handoff above governs
where their mandatory worksheet/generation procedure differs.

Discovery/test follow-up: layer skills now read broad architecture, registration
and export references only for an unresolved fact. Discovery reports occur after
initial owner reads and again after ten further files or five minutes without a
change. The threshold triggers communication, not a forced write. Plans pass
pattern decisions, reasons and revisions. The first working result includes a
brief review of test justification before the pattern is repeated.

Forward verification measures reads that resolve no new fact, time to
communication and first working output, and test repair cost. Bounded harmless-change and fault
probes check both test stability and useful detection. These evaluations remain
TODO; the wording changes make no claim of measured speed or reliability.

The user selected skill changes first, then plans for tool fixes and forward
tests. Plans 021 and 022 are complete as recorded below.
The skill revision uses CRUD tables and custom workflow YAML, reuses discovery,
checks generation before detailed planning, and assigns one working path first.
The worksheet parser now reads CRUD tables as well as custom workflow records.

The final wording pass moved custom workflow YAML into a conditional reference,
defined shared rules with I-IDs, and removed repeated procedures from stage
entry points. The checker reads all repeated tables and rejects duplicate rule
and acceptance IDs. Early dependent assignments stay in one plan; cross-plan
dependencies require the complete predecessor.

| Plan | Priority | Effort | Risk | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [021: Submit without copy dependency](021-remove-submit-copy-dependency.md) | P1 | S | LOW | None | DONE — 2026-09-14, native submit locator, 21 tool tests pass |
| [022: Report raw controls](022-report-raw-interactive-controls.md) | P1 | S | MED | None | DONE — 2026-09-14, native controls reach review, 18 tests pass |
| [024: Prove shared form controls](024-prove-shared-form-controls.md) | P1 | M | MED | None | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-14, real Dialog/Table/calendar cases pass, helper regression passes |
| [025: Separate runtime and review freshness](025-separate-runtime-and-review-freshness.md) | P2 | S | MED | None | TODO |

Run the manual trial with the current skills. Plan 024 is already implemented
as recorded in the table above; plan 025 can follow
when its gap is relevant; it does not block this trial. Preserve existing
plan status and user application work.

| Finding | Category | Impact | Confidence | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| English submit selector | Bug/tests | Correct localized forms fail | HIGH | `scripts/scaffold-bounded-module.mjs:819`, `:831` |
| Raw controls pass without review | DX/tests | Framework replacements can be missed | HIGH | `scripts/module-ui-check.test.mjs:22` |
| Revised delivery behavior is unproved | Tests | Time and completeness remain uncertain | HIGH | Forward test run facts |

Earlier considered and rejected: removing the worksheet (then judged small;
superseded for standard CRUD after the later 102-edit planning trace); another
generator or skill (existing owners suffice); automatic relation/workflow
generation (business rules remain manual); calling static pass acceptance.
Plans 019–020 remain historical results, not proof of this new revision.

Scope: selected module skills, generator submission, UI checker, and evaluation
contracts. No full application, framework, security, dependency, deployment or
performance audit was performed. No new product direction was requested.
Skill validation passed for six changed skill folders, seven Node skill checks
passed, and two Python tests passed with new CRUD acceptance cases. The first
Python run failed because fixture tables lacked a separating blank line; the
fixture was corrected. Full runtime forward tests remain unrun.

Final handoff checks: `pnpm test:module-tooling` passed 92 Node tests and three
Python tests. Four workflow skill validations and `git diff --check` passed.
An old Node assertion required command text in the router; it failed after the
procedure moved to its reference. That wording assertion was removed; the
generator example check and reference-link checks remain. All five final skill
changes are complete.
The next skill pass defines framework/module test ownership in one reference,
checks assertions before expensive runs, and requires page/artifact diagnosis
after two failures at one browser interaction. Plan 024 closes real-control
coverage gaps and supplies shared helpers. Plan 025 separates runtime freshness
from design review; current recorder rules remain in force until it is complete.
Application and framework source were not changed in this skill pass. The new
rules still need the controlled trial; no speed improvement is claimed.

Checks for this pass: 96 Node tooling tests and three Python tests passed.
Both changed skill folders passed skill validation; `git diff --check` passed.
Framework browser tests and the controlled trial were not run. Concurrent
application changes were left untouched.

Planned with the improve skill against checkout `00763ed` on 2026-09-08.
Both plans passed parent review on 2026-09-09.

## Status

| Plan | Priority | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [001: Hidden tooling and editor support](001-hide-route-language-and-build-work.md) | P1 | None | DONE |
| [002: Framework and app migration](002-migrate-sprindle-and-carta-file-routes.md) | P1 | 001 | DONE |
| [003: Reject route import cycles](003-reject-route-import-cycles.md) | P1 | None | DONE |
| [004: Preserve external declaration paths](004-preserve-external-declaration-paths.md) | P1 | 003 | DONE |

## Delivered contract

HTTP methods and paths come from `+server.ts` files and named method exports.
Parent `+scope.ts` files supply context, identity, access checks, entities, and
record conversion. Parent hooks receive their own context and identity. Child
context can replace fields for descendants without changing parent checks.

Developers can add, move, or delete routes without a registration edit,
generated import, manual context type, or generation command. The normal build,
type-check, test, and development commands maintain private artifacts. The SDK
uses declarations emitted from the same contextual type view as the editor.
Type-only changes update those declarations. Plain consumer TypeScript checks
work after application route source is removed.

All 27 existing API method/path pairs are preserved. Database domain ownership
is separate from route ownership. Production runs in plain Node from a shared
ESM bundle. Development and tests use separate source manifests, so app request
state is shared and simultaneous build/test commands do not replace each
other's artifacts. No production request scans source files or loads a compiler.

## Parent verification

The parent ran these checks against the final implementation:

- `pnpm build --force`: six tasks passed, zero cache hits.
- `pnpm type-check --force`: six tasks passed, zero cache hits.
- `pnpm lint --force`: three tasks passed, zero cache hits.
- `pnpm test --force`: twelve tasks passed, zero cache hits. The unrestricted
  Sprindle suite has 184 tests; API has 72, SDK has 3, and web has 216.
- `pnpm test:module-tooling`: 47 tests passed.
- Sprindle isolated VS Code editor-host and editor-install tests: exit 0.
- [Language proof](proofs/file-routing/LANGUAGE.md): ten checks passed.
- [Runtime proof](proofs/file-routing/README.md): thirteen checks passed,
  including the counterexample for manifest-only source type inference.
- Cold normal development startup: HTTP asset URL projection, route addition,
  invalid-edit recovery, route move, and route deletion passed.
- Cached build and type-check after output removal: six cache hits each;
  required binaries, declarations, and API artifacts were restored. The SDK
  consumer check passed after each restoration.
- Direct plain Node import of the production application returned 200 from
  `/health`. The isolated production test runs a copied bundle without app
  source, the Sprindle package, or a TypeScript loader.
- `git diff --check` and the obsolete production registration search passed.

The API test target guard reported `VALID` for the separate `carta_test`
database before migrations and tests. The existing ignored `.env.test` was
missing its purpose and name markers; those two markers were added. Database
credentials and the target URL were not changed.

Earlier review failures were corrected before approval. The full framework
suite is enabled. Tests cover parent rejection and error unwinding, middleware,
parsed write hooks, type and runtime inheritance, declaration publication from
concurrent processes, failed-build preservation, path aliases, exact literal
outputs, type-only edits, and production/development request state.

## Editor setup and limits

Run `pnpm setup:editor` once to install the project language support. No route
generation command is needed. The parent tested installation in an isolated
profile; the user's editor profile was not changed.

VS Code 1.136.1 on macOS is the tested editor. The extension supports one
TypeScript project at a time. Context rename refuses edits because complete
cross-file references cannot yet be proved. Source add, move, and delete,
context inference, diagnostics, completion, and definitions are supported.
See [tooling documentation](../packages/sprindle/docs/file-routing-tooling.md).

## Boundaries

Work stayed in the current checkout. No other branch, worktree, or historical
implementation was inspected. No commit, push, publication, deployment,
application schema migration, or development database reset was performed.

## Follow-up plan 003

Plan 003 was written with the improve skill at `83c0cf9` on 2026-09-10.
It is independent of other pending module work. It preserves the completed

The bundle contains the reported undefined auth domain. A focused check also
found that native ESM fails when the same graph is loaded through the scope
first. The plan therefore breaks the application cycle and rejects static
local import cycles before publication. It also gives E2E its own source
manifest so application modules are shared.

Considered and rejected: treating the graph as safe for every ESM entry order;
waiting for route readiness; skipping undefined domains; changing import order
to hide the fault; and adding a new compiled-module system for this fix.

Planning checks: six existing Sprindle manifest tests passed. The minimal
in-memory reproduction confirmed both the native ESM initialization error and
the delayed bundle error. No database reset, live HTTP check, or browser E2E
was run. This was not a full framework or repository audit.

Final review of plan 003 passed on 2026-09-10. The standard Sprindle tooling
suite passed all 37 tests after the timeout and process-cleanup correction.
The API build and all 4 selected API tests passed. Type-check, lint, and patch
checks passed. Browser E2E was not run. See the plan for the full evidence,
earlier failures, and the separate external declaration-emission limit.

## API dev-startup performance — 2026-09-11

Planned with the improve skill against checkout `99d77a5` on 2026-09-11.
Scope: `perf` only. The user reported ~15 s dev startup (2741 ms compile +
6767 ms watcher + 1162 ms manifest load). The user selected the top 2
findings for plans. Read-only analysis only; no source changed during
planning. Working tree was clean (`git status --short` empty).

### Measured evidence (all on this checkout, `bundle=false`)

- Full API compile: 2424 ms cold-ish, warm 1959 ms. Scope: 24 routes,
  5 scopes, 29 route files plus ~44 esbuild metafile inputs.
- 1-route fixture compile: 326 ms cold, 143-161 ms warm. Fixed declaration
  cost dominates the API compile.
- Manifest import under tsx: 936-1372 ms, stable across runs. Plain Node
  import was not measurable (source manifest holds `.ts` specifiers).
- Server phases on port 5199 reproduce the report: manifest 1191 ms,
  app 24 ms, database 2 ms, bind 0 ms.
- Framework imports under tsx: sprindle/hono ~700 ms, create-app ~788 ms,
  db module ~632-674 ms, first `getDb()` ~1 ms, `defineDomainSchema` ~1 ms.

### Findings table

| # | Finding | Category | Impact | Effort | Risk | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PERF-01 | Dev, test, and temp manifests emit TypeScript declarations | perf | ~2 s of every ~2.4 s dev compile; 3 compiles per startup | S | LOW | `packages/sprindle/src/tooling/manifest.ts:69` always calls `emitRouteDeclarations`; dev uses `.sprindle-dev` (`apps/api/scripts/dev.ts:5`), test uses `.sprindle-test` (`apps/api/scripts/compile-routes.ts:2`), temp dir in `apps/api/scripts/build-production.ts:14` |
| PERF-02 | Dev startup compiles the manifest 3 times | perf | 2 redundant ~2.4 s compiles before the server starts | S | LOW | `apps/api/scripts/dev.ts:9` explicit compile, then `watchRouteManifest` runs `compile(); await queue; compile(); await queue` (`packages/sprindle/src/tooling/manifest.ts:252`) |
| PERF-03 | Watcher scans the whole API project, not routes plus inputs | perf | Every keystroke recompiles on any project file change; dozens of watchers held open | S | LOW | `watch(project, { recursive: true })` at `manifest.ts:235` plus `directories(project)` at line 240; 51 watch-candidate dirs counted; no route/input scoping |
| PERF-04 | Dev manifest is source-only while production is bundled | perf | ~1 s tsx transform per server start plus per-route transform churn on reload | M | MED | `dev.ts:9` and watcher use `bundle=false`; production `tooling/build.mjs:8` bundles; manifest import under tsx measured ~1 s |
| PERF-05 | Versioned `contracts/` dirs accumulate, stale tmp files remain | perf | 8.7 MB across 10 contract versions in `.sprindle-dev`; 4 orphan `.tmp` files; no pruning | S | LOW | `apps/api/.sprindle-dev/contracts/` listing at audit time (ignored output); `manifest.ts:146-150` renames without cleanup; failed-compile tmp files observed |
| PERF-06 | Server imports manifest, app, and db serially | perf | ~150-300 ms of chained tsx transforms | S | LOW | `apps/api/src/server.ts:13-26` awaits hono import, manifest, create-app, db in sequence; each import measured 600-800 ms cold under tsx |

Direction findings: none. This was a focused perf audit, not a direction pass.

### Status

| Plan | Title | Priority | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [005](005-skip-dev-declarations.md) | Skip type declarations for development and test manifests | P1 | None | DONE (manifest.spec 14 pass; auth-manifest 2 pass; test:dev-routes pass ~9.2 s; type-checks + lints exit 0; production build.mjs untouched) |
| [006](006-single-dev-compile.md) | Compile once and wait for watcher readiness on dev startup | P1 | 005 (time saving; logic works alone) | DONE (manifest.spec 15 pass incl. single-compile test; tooling.spec 5 pass; test:dev-routes pass ~10.4 s; type-checks + lints exit 0; pre-existing macOS FSEvents phantom-compile flake documented in 006 deviation note) |
| [007](007-narrow-route-watcher.md) | Narrow the route watcher to routes plus compiled inputs | P2 | None (keep 005/006 signatures if landed) | DONE (manifest.spec 17 pass incl. 2 new scope tests, 10 consecutive full-file passes; tooling.spec 5 pass x2; test:dev-routes pass ~8.4 s; type-checks + lint exit 0) |

Execute 005 → 006, 007 any time after drift check. 005 removes ~2 s per compile; 006 removes 2 compiles.
007 removes spurious recompiles during editing (no startup gain by itself).
Together 005+006 remove ~6-7 s from the ~15 s startup. Either plan alone still helps.

### Findings considered and rejected

- Bundle the dev manifest (PERF-04): deferred; changes reload semantics and
  the auth-manifest source-mode contract. Needs its own design pass.
- Prune contracts and tmp files (PERF-05): housekeeping, not startup time.
  Safe follow-up, unplanned.
- Parallelize server imports (PERF-06): small gain (~150-300 ms), touches
  boot order. Unplanned.
- Database or `defineDomainSchema` as the cause: rejected with evidence;
  first `getDb()` ~1 ms, schema define ~1 ms, pool connect lazy.

## Follow-up plan 004

The user selected the existing temporary-folder approach on 2026-09-10 to get
sibling source imports working quickly. Plan 004 keeps the TypeScript CLI and
maps discovered source and declaration files relative to a common ancestor.
It depends on the completed but uncommitted plan 003 changes.

The virtual-emitter alternative is deferred. The installed TypeScript 7.0.2
public emitter exposes `printNode`; declaration emission through that API was
not proved. The implementation must establish the sibling-import regression
and portable consumer proof before completion. No new compiler architecture,
application configuration, or user generation command is planned.


## Backend generation performance — 2026-09-12

Planned with the improve skill at commit `6fa00d4`. The user selected findings
1, 2, and 4 in that order. This is authorization to write plans, not to execute
them. Finding 3 requires separate explicit permission before further work.
Existing plans 001–007 remain complete; plan 008 is a separate approved E2E
design and is not superseded by these plans.

| Plan | Finding and title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [009](009-limit-route-declaration-inputs.md) | 1: Limit declaration entry files to route dependencies | P1 | M | None | DONE |
| [010](010-reuse-route-declarations.md) | 2: Reuse valid declarations on unchanged builds | P1 | M | 009 | DONE |
| [011](011-build-route-bundle-once.md) | 4: Build each route bundle once | P2 | M | 010 | DONE (2→1 bundle calls proved by 4 new tests; 53/53 tooling pass; no speedup claimed; approved by the user on 2026-09-12) |

Plan 011 was refined on 2026-09-12 against `a80bfc5` plus the uncommitted
009/010 source. It now gives source fingerprints, two exact helper algorithms,
four named tests, fixed edit points, and repeatable measurement commands. This
 refinement does not resume execution; the pause after plan 010 remains active.


The user authorized delegated execution of 009 → 010 → 011 on 2026-09-12. Plan
009 establishes declaration roots before reuse is added. Plan 010 must include
all type inputs, not only runtime dependencies. Plan 011 comes last by user
priority and changes the same publication path; keep the preceding reuse checks
intact. Completed prerequisite diffs are expected changes during later plans'
drift checks.

Plan 010 uses a TypeScript file-resolution probe and content hashes before it
reuses a declaration. A separate-process test records one declaration emit on
the first build, none on an unchanged second build, and a second emit after a
route edit. The final API measurement recorded a 17.80-second miss and a
4.41-second median for the next four hits, with high host wall-time variance.
Invalid metadata, incomplete inventories, damaged files, and output links that
leave the private directory cause safe misses. The generator, compiler, config,
framework, selected external files, and workspace metadata are part of the key.

A plan 010 review revision fixes recovery when the content-version path is a
dangling symbolic link. The old code failed with `ENOTDIR`. The generator now
uses `lstatSync` to detect the link entry and publishes a valid immutable repair
version while it keeps the old link and backup. The next unchanged process
reuses that repair without another declaration emit. The isolated regression
failed before the fix, and the final tooling suite passed all 49 tests.

The user paused this sequence after plan 010. Plan 011 remains TODO and does not
start until the user asks to resume. Finding 3 still requires separate explicit
permission.

### Audit evidence and limits

Scope: route generation in `apps/api`, `packages/sprindle`, and their command
configuration. The API has 24 routes and 5 scopes. Read-only measurements:

- Route scan: 114 ms first run, 6–9 ms on repeat runs.
- In-memory esbuild analysis: 325 ms first run, 8–10 ms on repeat runs.
- Contextual overlay: 123 files, including 14 test files and 12 scripts;
  preparation took 216 ms first run, 29–34 ms on repeat runs.
- Contextual diagnostics: 2229 ms, zero diagnostics.
- Plain API TypeScript check: 1243 ms compiler-reported total, exit 0.

These are separate stage measurements, not a complete generation benchmark.
The initial measurement command could not resolve `tsx` from the repository
root; the corrected command used the installed API loader and passed. Full
builds, tooling test suites, database tests, and browser tests were not run during
this planning pass. Each plan lists implementation verification gates.
Source files were not changed. Existing Loom work remains outside scope.

Evidence: `packages/sprindle/src/tooling/manifest.ts:123` promotes all overlay
TypeScript files to declaration roots; `language.ts:209` collects the project;
`manifest.ts:70` always emits declarations; `manifest.ts:140` checks the version
after emission; `manifest.ts:60` and `:68` build the same graph twice.

### Deferred and rejected work

- Finding 3: repeated type checks in `apps/api/package.json:15–16`. DEFERRED
  until the user gives explicit permission. No plan was written. Plans 009–011
  must preserve declaration validation, contextual diagnostics, and plain `tsc`.
- Old startup findings: declaration skipping, single initial compile, and
  narrower watchers are already implemented by 005–007. Do not plan them again.
- Runtime-hash-only declaration reuse: rejected because type-only edits can
  change the consumer contract without changing runtime inputs.
- Full compiler replacement, persistent compiler service, broad incremental
  staging, and new cache dependencies: outside the selected scope.
- Route-scan micro-optimization: lower value at the measured 6–9 ms repeat cost.
- Database migration generation, request performance, frontend behavior, and a
  full framework audit were not included. No direction findings were requested.

## E2E iteration speed — 2026-09-12

Design: [008](008-e2e-iteration-design.md). Plans reviewed against `cdbc12b`
with the improve skill on 2026-09-12. Only plans changed during this review.
No E2E timing or implementation test was run. Plans 009–011 are unrelated.

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [012](012-e2e-iteration-prepare-once.md) | Prepare once per worker and reuse local servers | P1 | M | None | DONE — unit, guard, iteration, and default gates pass; medians 48.73 s cold, 33.49 s warm prepare, 10.85 s warm skip |
| [013](013-e2e-fast-auth.md) | Reuse API auth state after preparation | P2 | S | 012 DONE with evidence | IMPLEMENTED — combined, repeat, and default proofs pass; equivalent timing incomplete |
| [014](014-e2e-failure-bundle.md) | Preserve failure evidence in one local bundle | P2 | M | None | IMPLEMENTED — failed and green proofs pass; timing incomplete; collector review and 8 Node tests pass |

Recommended order: 012 → 013 → 014. Plan 014 can run independently; retain any
fixture changes already made by 012/013. Use DONE with evidence for dependency
checks. Do not require an undefined VERIFIED status.

Plan 012 measures reset-count savings separately from server reuse and explicit
skip-prepare reuse. Warm servers run in owned terminals, and backend changes
require a compile/restart. Plan 013 creates auth after prepare and stores it in
worker memory. The UI journey keeps a separate session. Plan 014 improves failure
diagnosis, not passing-test speed. It adds bounded missing diagnostics and uses
the existing trace for DOM details.

### Review findings

All findings have HIGH confidence from direct source and plan reads. Effort is
for the plan correction; implementation effort is in the status table above.

| Finding | Category | Impact | Effort | Fix risk | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server reuse needs an external process owner | perf | Separate CLI runs otherwise still pay startup | S | LOW | `apps/web/playwright.config.ts:53–70`; installed Playwright `lib/runner/index.js:836–851` stops processes it starts |
| Prepare-once must be restricted to iteration | correctness | An unconditional module flag removes default per-test isolation | S | MED | `apps/web/e2e/fixtures.ts:48–53`; original 012 step 3 omitted the default branch |
| Auth must follow prepare and remain separate from logout | correctness | Reset deletes cached sessions; global state breaks anonymous/logout cases | S | MED | `apps/api/scripts/reset-e2e.ts:6–31`; `apps/web/e2e/auth.spec.ts:16–25` |
| Report data needs explicit capture and private storage | dx/security | JSON has no network field; raw traces can contain session data | S | MED | installed Playwright `types/testReporter.d.ts:329–359`; `.gitignore:30–32`; `apps/web/e2e/fixtures.ts:48` |
| Prefix helper cannot control API object keys | tech-debt | Unused helper gives a false cleanup contract | S | LOW | `apps/api/src/routes/(authenticated)/files/presigned-url/+server.ts:17–19` |
| Dependencies and proof commands were inconsistent | docs/tests | Executor could update the wrong plan or stop on normal dependency changes | S | LOW | Original 013/014 referred to 009–011 and wrong status rows; `apps/api/package.json:19` focused test also migrates Vitest DB |

### Design details corrected in this review

- Keep design 008's local iteration and full acceptance goals. Explicitly start
  warm servers outside Playwright; `reuseExistingServer` alone cannot retain them.
- Use API storage state in memory after prepare. A setup project and shared disk
  file add reset-order problems without a current need.
- Keep raw bundles in ignored local reports. DOM remains in the native trace;
  standalone console/network summaries require fixture capture.
- Keep the owned-object cleanup rule, but defer its implementation until an
  upload journey exists. The server chooses the actual object key.

### Findings considered and rejected

- More E2E workers: rejected; the suite shares one mutable E2E database.
- Faster prepare on a one-case run from a worker flag alone: rejected; one case
  already prepares once. Measure server startup and explicit state reuse instead.
- New auth setup project or persistent session cache: not needed for the current
  serial read-only RBAC cases. Reconsider only with measured need.
- S3 prefix helper now: rejected; no caller and no API prefix input.
- Failure bundle as a passing-test speed improvement: rejected; measure diagnosis
  usefulness and successful-run overhead separately.

### Review scope and limits

Reviewed the three plans, design 008, their index, E2E config and all current
browser specs, reset/seed/storage guards, auth route contract, related scripts,
package commands, web CI, and installed Playwright report/server behavior.
No source, framework, database, storage, or environment file was changed.
Product modules, a full framework audit, dependency security, and infrastructure
performance were not audited. No new product direction was proposed.

## Symmetric asset fields — 2026-09-12

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [015](015-symmetric-asset-fields.md) | Keep asset fields symmetric through read, edit and submit | P1 | M | None | IMPLEMENTED — REWORK revision verified on `sallliisa/improve-carta-module-dev`, independent review still open |

The user selected this migration. Reuse the existing asset schema and adapters;
keep category and other business data in applications. Plan 015 covers file
typing, value preservation, upload readiness and an executable form example.
It is independent of the paused routing and E2E plans above. No source or runtime
check was changed or run during this planning pass. Skill conventions are updated
separately under the user's explicit request; pending framework support is marked.

## Faster Carta module delivery — 2026-09-12

Planned with `$improve` against commit `7eb093d`. The user selected all four
parts after discussion. The order is configuration, local readiness, bounded
generation, then skill alignment and controlled measurement. This task changed
plans only. It did not implement source, change either external project, apply a
migration, run a seed, or start a service.

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [016](016-centralize-app-port-settings.md) | Read application ports only from each app environment | P1 | S | None | IMPLEMENTED — review APPROVE 2026-09-12; E2E-case run deferred to 017 |
| [017](017-prepare-local-module-environment.md) | Prepare and check the local module environment | P1 | M | 016 | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-12, tool tests pass; live DB/S3/E2E integration blocked by missing local services |
| [018](018-expand-bounded-module-generator.md) | Generate selected standard module actions and their proof | P1 | L | 016, 017 | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-13, tooling 84+2 pass, both type-checks pass; live migration/seed/API/browser runs blocked by missing local services |
| [019](019-align-module-workflow-and-measure-time.md) | Use the new module path and measure its effect | P1 | M | 016, 017, 018 | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-13, trials green, repairs committed; no speed claim |
| [020](020-accept-separator-and-fix-review.md) | Accept the pnpm separator and correct the workflow review findings | P1 | S | 019 | IMPLEMENTED — review APPROVE, 2026-09-13 |

The generator stays in the current command. It creates only selected standard
actions and the technical read that Update needs. It uses Drizzle for one reviewed
migration, registers only exact seed records, and creates useful API and browser
proof when the path is standard. Custom Detail pages, relations, dependent input,
child resources, scoped access, workflows, concurrency, existing-data changes,
custom queries, and reports stay in normal module work.

Ports have one owner in each app `.env`. The prepared-environment work adds one
idempotent file setup command and one read-only preflight. The final plan updates
the existing skills with short pointers and compares two controlled module runs.
Raw evaluation logs remain ignored and redacted.

The source evidence includes two supplied time reports. Project A reports about
6-7 hours of active work, a 72-minute empty worker, and 106 minutes of broad work
without a usable result. Project B reports 5 hours 35 minutes, 8.18 million input
tokens, five compactions, and 121 minutes in E2E and verification. The new plans
do not claim a time reduction before the controlled runs are complete.

### Approaches considered and rejected

- A second module generator or new skill would create two contracts. Extend the
  current bounded command and reference.
- Shared port defaults or compatibility aliases would keep more than one owner.
  Read only the two app `.env` files and fail on invalid values.
- Automatic migration application, seed execution, or E2E data reset would make
  generation destructive. Generate and report these artifacts, then stop.
- Relation, workflow, scope, report, and custom Detail generation would make the
  first version guess business behavior. Keep those parts in the module plan.
- Generated source-shape tests repeat renderer logic. Generate direct API and
  browser behavior proof when the standard path can support it.

## Form write-schema seam — 2026-09-15

Planned with the improve skill against commit `783ac5d` on 2026-09-15.
Scope: web form schemas that hand-build create/update slots around the Hono
seam. A form used a read/enriched select shape as its base and guessed the
server-owned omit list; type-check, lint, and the API spec passed, and submit
failed silently (issues for fields with no visible input render nowhere:
`packages/loom/src/components/core/Form.vue:177,357`). Plans write new
implementation; no source was changed during planning. Working tree was
stashed first (`stash@{0}`: forward-testing trash + seam proof WIP); the
`document-types` module files it needs live in the stash untracked commit.

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [026](026-form-write-schema-seam.md) | Check form write schemas against the Hono wire input in defineEntitySchema | P1 | M | — | DONE — 2026-09-15, dual-shape overloads (bare entity + direct), input-direction + phantom-required checks, 10 type-test cases, type-check + 8 spec tests + lint pass; parent review caught and fixed 4 subagent deviations (see plan) |
| [027](027-migrate-web-schemas-to-seam.md) | Migrate hand-built web schemas onto defineEntitySchema and delete redundant aliases | P1 | S | 026 | SUPERSEDED — 2026-09-15; keep the completed roles migration, but use 029 for all remaining current-tree work; absent document-types/validation-results modules remain absent |
| [028](028-form-orphan-issue-backstop.md) | Make silent Form validation failures impossible (orphan-issue backstop) | P2 | S | 026 | DONE — 2026-09-15, `orphanValidationIssues` in select.ts + dev-throw/prod-toast+alert in Form.vue, 3 new form.spec tests, full loom suite 57 files/450 tests pass, type-check + lint clean; parent verified no other validateDraftAsync callers affected, prod branch review-only (jsdom runs dev branch) |

Historical execution order: 026 → partial 027, then 028 with Loom authority.
Plan 029 supersedes the remaining 027 work. Plan 028 is defense in depth
(runtime visibility net, not the compile-time gate).

### Findings considered and rejected

- Runtime-only Form assert as the primary fix: rejected; the Form submit path
  runs outside all delivery gates (E2E excluded), so it would not be seen
  during development. Kept as plan 028 backstop only.
- Per-module submit specs: rejected; schema shape is proved once at the seam
  type-test, not per module.
- Docs/"remember to omit" comments: rejected; comments do not fail builds.
- API entity changes: rejected; entities already own the correct schemas.

## Unified app resource schema seam — 2026-09-15

Planned with `$improve` against commit `59ba2d1` on 2026-09-15. Scope: make
one Carta web schema seam support Hono and custom resource contracts, migrate
all current app and generator callers, then remove Loom's no-op schema builder.
Planning changed only files under `plans/`. The untracked proof source remains
unchanged for the implementer to fold into permanent tests.

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [029](029-centralize-app-resource-schema-seam.md) | Make one app schema seam support Hono and custom resource contracts | P1 | L | — | COMPLETE — 2026-09-15; reviewed and checked |
| [030](030-remove-loom-schema-builder.md) | Remove Loom's schema builder and keep generic resource values | P1 | M | 029 | COMPLETE — 2026-09-15; reviewed and checked |

Execution order: 029 → 030. Plan 029 leaves Loom's old builder only for Loom's
own callers, while the app boundary test prevents web code from using it. Plan
030 removes the builder after the app migration is complete.

### Proof status

The prototype proves the core overload and runtime design: Hono CRUD and
read-only routes, exact record types, required and forbidden write slots,
custom runtime and type-only contracts, parsed-output write compatibility, and
users `{ id }` input without `.passthrough()`. Web type-check and focused lint
passed. The focused test passed with `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`; the first
normal run stopped before collection with `EMFILE: too many open files, watch`.
Plan 029 moves this proof into permanent tests and adds inferred-custom,
query, identity, and validator coverage before migration is accepted. The full
repository migration is planned, not yet implemented or proven.

### Findings

| Finding | Category | Impact | Effort | Risk | Confidence | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web code can bypass the Hono contract through Loom's identity-only builder | correctness / architecture | HIGH | L | MED | HIGH | `apps/web/src/framework/hono/entity.ts`; current Loom imports in web schemas, fixtures, and tests |
| The current Hono write check compares raw Zod input, but Form submits parsed output | correctness | HIGH | M | MED | `apps/web/src/framework/hono/entity.ts:40-56`; `packages/loom/src/components/core/Form.vue:379-381`; passing prototype assertions |
| App callers, generator output, agent skills, and architecture docs teach two schema paths | DX / tech debt | HIGH | M | LOW | `scripts/scaffold-bounded-module.mjs`; both named skill files; web architecture document |
| Loom's public `defineSchema` is a no-op after the app seam owns adaptation | tech debt / API | MED | M | MED | `packages/loom/src/resources/defineSchema.ts`; `defineResource` already accepts `WebResourceSchemaBoundary` |

### Approaches considered and rejected

- Put Hono support in Loom: rejected. Loom must provide generic resource
  contracts. Carta web owns the transport-provider assumption.
- Keep `defineEntitySchema` or the Loom builder as an alias: rejected. Either
  name leaves a second path that can bypass the current contract.
- Add a separate record-only overload: rejected. Conditional Hono members and
  the explicit custom-contract overload cover read-only resources with the same
  implementation.
- Restore absent `document-types` or `validation-results` files: rejected. They
  are not part of the current tree and this migration must not invent them.

This is a focused migration audit, not a full security, performance, database,
or product-behavior audit. Those areas are outside Plans 029 and 030.

## RPC pit-of-success — 2026-09-19

Planned with `improve` at `2d6b378`. Scope: the `rpc.coffeeSales` 404 plus the
`rpc is unknown` baseline from the same incident. Verified during planning:
with the contract present `rpc.coffeeSales` is TS2339; with
`apps/api/.sprindle` deleted every `rpc` use is TS18046 plus TS2307 on the
contract import. No `rpc.camelCase` dot access exists on the current tree.
Scaffold emits only `rpc['<slug>']` (`scripts/scaffold-bounded-module.mjs:533,615,656`).

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [042](042-gate-type-check-on-route-contract.md) | Gate web type-check on the generated route contract | P1 | S | — | DONE — 2026-09-19, review APPROVE with one test-cleanup revision (unused import removed); self-heal proof passed (deleted `.sprindle` regenerates via `type-check`, exit 0, byte-identical contract) |
| [043](043-windows-safe-contract-links.md) | Make contract staging links Windows-safe | P1 | S | — | DONE — 2026-09-19, review APPROVE (helper plus `vi.mock('node:fs')` recorder test in `manifest.spec.ts`, not `tooling.spec.ts`, since the tooling suite spawns child processes; 37 tooling tests pass, lint and type-check clean) |
| [044](044-reject-unknown-resource-routes.md) | Reject unknown resource routes at the app seam | P2 | S | 042 | DONE — 2026-09-19, review APPROVE as written (fail-fast guard with kebab-case hint, 2 action tests, SDK hyphen positives plus camelCase negative, 2 scaffold bracket assertions; all suites and lint clean) |

Execute 042 and 043 in any order, then 044. Plan 042 makes the contract
self-healing through the web `type-check` script; 043 makes that build
reliable on Windows (`junction`); 044 adds the fail-fast guard, compiler
negatives, and generator assertions.

Considered and rejected: camelCase-to-kebab-case runtime aliases (keeps two
names for one route); a regex lint rule for `rpc.camelCase` (type-check
already rejects it once the contract exists); documenting "remember to
build" (comments do not fail builds).

## List query key types — 2026-09-19

Planned with `improve` at `fd53981`. A forward test wrote
`list({ query: { defaultSort: '-createdAt' } })`; the bare-string type let it
through and it failed only at runtime with
`Unknown sort column "-createdAt"`. This plan types `defaultSort`,
`enumFilters`, and `searchColumns` against the entity, adds the missing
`defaultOrder`, and keeps `pinnedOrder` for mandatory order. No POS module
files change; the forward-test worktree is throwaway.

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [050](050-list-query-key-types.md) | Type list query keys and support default order | P1 | M | — | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-19; route-schema 7 pass (4 new type tests), list-policy 7 pass (2 new runtime tests), focused 60 pass, full Sprindle 217 pass (33 files), Sprindle type-check 0, lint 0 warnings/errors, API type-check 0, diff --check 0 |

## Framework pit migration from POS forward-test — 2026-09-19

Planned with `improve` at `b44b82b`. POS work was a forward-test only. These
plans change framework seams plus gates. They do not fix POS module files.
POS routes under `apps/web/src/routes/(authenticated)/pos/` and API orders
under `apps/api/src/routes/(authenticated)/orders/` serve as read-only
fixtures for cases and demo runs.

Intent and nuance: record omission stays legal for truly non-readable rows.
Silent omission was the defect only because POS orders should stay readable
as history. The track keeps runtime hiding silent for users and makes the
author choice explicit at build time. `list` and `create` never gate by row.

| Plan | Title | Priority | Effort | Depends on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [045](045-display-pit-non-string-fields.md) | Require explicit display for non-string visible fields | P1 | M | — | DONE — reviewed 2026-09-19; helper tightened for enum/selection, mirror agreement test, Loom 477 pass, tool tests pass |
| [046](046-dialogform-composition-guard.md) | Fail fast on empty custom DialogForm composition | P1 | S | — | DONE — reviewed 2026-09-19; dev-only Form guard names schema keys plus missing fields and fromZod, DialogForm forwards unchanged, Loom 482 pass |
| [047](047-derive-record-ops-from-actions.md) | Derive standard record ops from declared resource actions | P1 | M | — | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-19; Loom type-check 0, full Loom 488 pass (incl. 6 new derivation specs), web adapter 6 pass, fixed triple removed, web type-check blocked only by pre-existing read-only POS `orders.schema` error (proved identical without this diff); review open |
| [048](048-custom-actions-row-gating.md) | Gate custom record actions by row through declared actions | P1 | M | 047 | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-19, revised per review to explicit trailing `{ record }` row context (no global registry; adapter stays standard-only); Loom type-check 0, full Loom 497 pass (incl. 9 new custom row-context specs), web adapter 6 pass, no hard-coded product ops, no POS/API files modified; review open |
| [049](049-row-op-sync-gate.md) | Static gate and docs for row-op sync | P2 | S | 047, 048 | IMPLEMENTED — 2026-09-19; static row-op rule in module-ui-check (review-only) with 6-case tool test, docs/ui/surfaces.md rule, RowOpCoverage type pattern in resource-actions.type-test; tooling 98 pass, Loom type-check 0, full Loom 497 pass; POS demo shows display reviews only (live orders enum covers all declared ops, permission-only resources pass per 047 — plan excerpt drift reported); review open |

Execute 045 and 046 in any order, then 047 → 048 → 049. Plans 047 and 048
touch the shared access path; run them serially. Plan 049 proves the sync
without a browser.

### Findings considered and rejected

- Mandatory `renderer: 'text'` for plain strings: rejected; plain strings keep
  the default. Only non-string kinds require explicit display.
- Runtime logs for hidden View: rejected; hidden controls are normal denial UX.
- Auto-adding `'detail'` whenever permission exists: rejected; some rows are
  deliberately non-readable. The author must decide per status.
- Fixing POS routes inside these plans: rejected; POS is fixture-only by user
  direction. Framework proofs use minimal inline fixtures plus POS demo runs.
